7-A. Remote-Work Policy (addendum)
Alchemyst operates as a “remote-first, hub-optional” company. The remote-work policy below applies to all employees who perform their duties outside an Alchemyst office, whether full-time, hybrid or ad-hoc.

Eligibility
All regular full-time employees are automatically eligible for remote work, unless their role has a clear, documented on-site requirement (e.g., certain facilities, hardware-lab, or customer-equipment roles).

Part-time and temporary staff may request remote status with manager approval.

Newly hired employees are expected to spend their first two weeks in the office (or on-site with their team) for orientation and equipment pickup.

Core requirements
Topic	Standard
Workday length	6 hours per day (same as on-site), with at least 3 hours overlapping the team’s published core hours (10:00–16:00 US Eastern).
Work location	A secure, private space inside your home country of hire. International work longer than 30 consecutive days requires HR approval for tax and compliance reasons.
Connectivity	Minimum 25 Mbps down / 5 Mbps up, hard-wired or reliable Wi-Fi. A speed-test screenshot is required during onboarding.
Availability	Status set in Slack; camera-on participation in all-hands, sprint reviews, and customer calls unless bandwidth prevents it.
Company-provided resources
Item	Allowance / ownership
Laptop & accessories	Standard issue Mac/PC + external keyboard, mouse, and up to 2 monitors (company property).
Ergonomic chair	Reimbursed up to $400 every five years.
Remote-work stipend	$50 / month (taxable) toward internet or co-working fees; auto-paid with the second payroll of each month.
IT support	24 h SLA for equipment replacement; on-site swap centres in New York, Austin, and Berlin.
Security & compliance
All work must be performed on an encrypted company laptop with up-to-date endpoint protection.

Public-Wi-Fi use requires VPN connection; passwords must be stored in the approved password manager (1Password).

Confidential materials may not be printed or stored locally without written approval.

Expense & travel guidelines
Remote employees are expected on-site up to four times per year for team weeks, client kick-offs, or company off-sites; travel booked through Concur is reimbursed 100%.

Additional voluntary office visits follow the standard travel-expense policy.

Performance management
Objectives, key results and performance reviews are identical for on-site and remote staff.

Managers review Slack activity, Jira throughput and OKR progress—not “green-bubble presence”—to gauge productivity.

Persistent failure to meet deliverables, respond during core hours, or comply with security policies may result in loss of remote privileges.

Health & safety
Employees must complete a home-office self-assessment checklist (lighting, ergonomics, electrical safety) within 30 days of remote approval.

Work-related injuries occurring at home are covered by workers’ compensation; incidents must be reported within 24 h.

Policy changes
TalentWise reserves the right to amend the remote-work policy to address compliance, tax, or operational needs. Employees will be given a minimum 30-day notice of material changes.

8. Additional Perks
$50/month remote-work stipend (internet or co-working)

Quarterly wellness challenges with prizes

Employee referral bonus up to $3 000
